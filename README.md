# 🔊 V-Soundboard

A quick soundboard mobile app built with **React Native + Expo** — designed as a fun gift project to play sound effects like golf swings, gun reloads, and army radio clips.

## 📱 Features

- 🎯 6 preloaded sound buttons with emojis
- 📡 Custom title screen
- 🔥 Built using Expo and tested on iOS (iPhone)

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- React Native
- Expo CLI
- expo-av (for sound playback)

## 🎨 Styling Notes

This was a quick and fun project, so:

- All styles are written inline using `StyleSheet.create()` inside each component
- No separate stylesheet files (e.g. `styles.js`) were created

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this app locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
